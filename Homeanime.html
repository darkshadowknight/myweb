            <p id="p_text">South Korean web novel written by Chugong, later adapted into a webtoon (manhwa) and an anime. 
                <br>
                    It follows Sung Jin-Woo, a weak E-rank hunter in a world where portals (gates)
                <br>
                connect Earth to dungeons filled with monsters. 
                <br>
                After a near-death experience in a deadly dungeon, he gains a mysterious "System", 
                <br>
                    which allows him to level up infinitelyâ€”something no other hunter can do.
