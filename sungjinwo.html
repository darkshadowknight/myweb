            <p id="p_jinwo">"Solo Leveling" is a popular Korean web novel written by Chugong, 
                <br>
                which was later adapted into a webtoon (manhwa) and eventually an anime.
                <br> 
                It follows Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest E-rank hunter in a world 
                <br>
                where humanity fights against monsters in dungeons.
                <br>
                Sung Jin-Woo: The Weakest to the Strongest
                <br>
                At the start, Jin-Woo is known as the "World's Weakest Hunter", 
                <br>
                barely surviving low-level dungeons. However, after a near-death experience in a 
                <br>
                Double Dungeon, 
                <br>
                he receives a mysterious power called the System, which allows him to 
                <br>
                level up infinitelyâ€”something 
                <br>
                unheard of in his world.
                <br>
                As he levels up, he transforms from a powerless hunter into 
                <br>
                the Strongest Hunter in the World, 
                <br>
                surpassing S-rank hunters and even the gods themselves. He gains powerful abilities, 
                <br>
                such as Shadow Extraction, allowing him to raise fallen enemies as his shadow soldiers, 
                <br>
                eventually leading a massive army.
